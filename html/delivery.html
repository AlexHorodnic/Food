                Along with kimchi, bibimbap takes its place among the favored foods in Korean cuisine. 
                Literally meaning 'mixed rice,' it's a popular meal consisting of white rice topped with
                vegetables, beef, a whole egg, and gochujang (red chili pepper paste). <br/><br/>For those who cannot
                handle the spiciness (like our children), you can substitute with soy sauce or Sriracha 
                (rooster sauce) in place of it.<br/><br/>
                When Sydney was in lock down we ate like royalty every night, there was the luxury of time to plan meals
                and our house ran like a well oiled machine, we didn’t eat take away for months so all left overs were
                eaten and despite the panic buying my pantry felt like it had some kind of coherence and order.
